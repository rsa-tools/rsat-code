=head1 USAGE

compare-matrices -file1 inputfile1 -file2 inputfile2 [-o outputfile] [-v #] [...]

=head1 INPUT FORMATS

The user has to specify exactly input files (options I<-file1> and
I<-file2>), each containing one or several PSSMs. Each matrix of file
one is compared with each matrix of file2.

Any PSSM format supported in RSAT (type I<convert-matrix -h> for a
description).

=head1 OUTPUT FORMATS

By default, the output format is a tab-delimited file with one row per
matrix comparison, and one column per statistics. Depending on the
requested output fields (option I<-return>), I<compare-matrices> can
also export a series of additional files.

=over

=item [output_prefix].tab

Tab-delimited text file containing the primary result (comparison
score table): one column per comparison (match or profile position),
one row per field (score, matrix descriptor, ...).

=item [output_prefix].html

HTML file presenting the comparison table in a user-friendly way. The
clickable headers allow to re-order the table according to any column.

=item [output_prefix].gml

Matrix comparison graph in GML format, which can be open with
CitoScape or Yed.

=item [output_prefix].dot

Matrix comparison graph in dot format, which can be open with
graphviz.

=item [output_prefix_alignments_pairwise.tab]

Tab-delimited text file containing the shifted matrices resulting from
pairwise alignments.

=item [output_prefix_alignments_pairwise.html]

HTML file presentig the pairwise alignments in a user-friendly way:
motifs are presented as sequence logos.

=item [output_prefix_alignments_1ton.tab]

Tab-delimited text file containing the shifted matrices resulting from
1-to-n alignments.

=item [output_prefix_alignments_1ton.html]

HTML file presentig the 1-to-n alignments in a user-friendly way:
motifs are presented as sequence logos.

=head1 ALGORITHM

The program successively computes one or several (dis)similiraty
metrics between each matrix of the first input file and each matrix of
the secnd input file.

Since the matrices are not supposed to be in phase, for each pair of
matrix, the program tests all possible I<offset> (shift) values
between the two matrices.

=head1 MATCHING SCORES

=head2 Symbols used for the metrics

In the formula below, symbols are defined as follows

=over

=item I<m1, m2>

Two position-specific scoring matrices.

=item I<w1,w2>

Number of columns of matrices m1 and m2, respectively.

=item Row number I<r>

Number of rows in each matrix, which correspond to the number of
residues in the alphabet (A,C,G,T for DNA motifs).

=item Aligned length I<w>

Number of aligned columns between matrices m1 and m2 (depends on the
offset between the two matrices).

 w <= w1
 w <= w2

=item Total length I<W>

Total length of the alignent between matrices m1 and m2.

 W = w1 + w2 - w

=item Relative lengths I<Wr, wr1, wr2>

A measure of the mutual overlap between the aligned matrices.

  Wr = w / W

This actually corresponds to the Jaccard coefficient (intersection /
union), applied to the alignment lengths.

The program also computes the width relative to each of the aligned
matrices.

  wr1 = w / w1
  wr2 = w / w2

=item I<s1, s2>

Number of sites in matrices m1 and m2, respectively.

=item I<n>

Number of cells in the aligned portion of the matrices.

 n = w * r

=item I<i>

Index of a row of the aligned PSSM (corresponds to a residue).

=item I<j>

Index of a column of the aligned PSSM (corresponds to an aligned
position).

=item I<f1{i,j}>

Frequency of I<ith> residue in the I<jth> column of the aligned subset of the
first matrix (taking the offset into account).

=item I<f2{i,j}>

Frequency of I<ith> residue in the I<jth> column of the aligned subset of the
second matrix (taking the offset into account).

=item I<f1m, f2m>

Mean frequency computed over all cells of matrices m1 and m2, respectively.

=back

=head2 Sum of Squared Distances (SSD)

BEWARE: this metrics is the real SSD, i.e. the simple sum of squared
distance. It is a distance metric, in contrast with the "SSD" defined
in STAMP, which is converted to a similarity metrics (see
Sandelin-Wasserman below).

 SSD = SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w} [(f1{i,j} - f2{i,j})^2)]

=head2 Sandelin-Wasserman similarity (SW)

Also implemented in STAMP (under the name SSD) and TOMTOM (under the
name Sandelin-Wasserman). This is a distance to similarity conversion
of the SSD. The conversion is ensured by substracting each squared
distance to a constant 2 (the max distance between two columns
containing relative frequencies, i.e. one residue has frequency 1 in
one column, and another residue has ffrequency 1 in the other column).

 SW = SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w} [2 - (f1{i,j} - f2{i,j})^2) ]

Source: Sandelin A & Wasserman WW (2004) J Mol Biol 338:207-215.

=head2 Normalized Sandelin-Wasserman similarity (NSW)

Sandelin-Wasserman (SW) similarity normalized by the number of aligned
columns (I<w>).

 NSW = SW / (2*w)

NSW takes a value comprized between 0 (not a single corresponding
residue) and 1 (matrices are identical for all the aligned columns).

=head2 Euclidian distance (dEucl)

 dEucl = sqrt( SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w} (f1{i,j} - f2{i,j})^2)

Since relative frequencies can take values from 0 to 1, the Euclidian
distance can take values from 0 to sqrt(2)*w.

=head2 Normalized Euclidian distance (NdEucl)

Euclidian distance normalized by the number of aligned columns
(I<w>).

 NdEucl = dEucl / w

NdEucl can take values from 0 to sqrt(2).

Note that this differs from the definition provided in Pape et
al. (2008).

=head2 Normalized Euclidian similarity (NsEucl)

A similarity metrics derived from the normalized Euclidian distance.

 NsEucl = (Max(NdEucl) - NdEucl) / Max(NdEucl)
        = (sqrt(2) - NdEucl) / sqrt(2)

where I<Max(NdEucl)>=sqrt(2) is the maximal possible Euclidian
distance for the current pair of matrices. The Normalized Euclidian
similarity can vary from 0 (idential matrices) to 1 (matrices with a
single residue per column, and those residues systematically differ
between the two matrices).

=head2 Kullback-Leibler distance (dKL)

As defined in Aerts et al. (2003). Also called B<Mutual Information>.

 dKL = 1/(2w) * SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w} (
                   f1{i,j}*log(f1{i,j}/f2{i,j})
                   + f2{i,j}*log(f2{i,j}/f1{i,j}))

Note that the KL distance is problematic for matrices containing zero
values: for example, if f1(i,k)=0 and f2(i,j)=1, we have :
  KL(i,j) = (0*log(0) + 1*log(1/0)) = 0 + log(Inf) = Inf

One can circumvent this problem by using pseudo-count corrected
matrices (f'(i,j)), but then the KL distance is strongly dependent on
the somewhat arbitrary choice of the pseudo-count value.

=head2 Covariance (cov)

 cov = 1/(r*w) * SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w} (f1{i,j} - f1m) * (f2{i,j} - f2m)

Beware : this is the classical covariance defined in statistical
textbooks. It has nothing to do with the "natural covariance" of Pape
(which still needs to be implemented here).  What we compute here is
simply the covariance between the counts in the aligned cells of the
respective matrices.

=head2 Coefficient of correlation (cor)

 v1 = 1/n * SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w} (f1{i,j} - f1m)^2
 v2 = 1/n * SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w} (f2{i,j} - f2m)^2
 cor = cov/ sqrt(v1*v2)

=head2 Normalized correlation (Ncor, Ncor1, Ncor2)

The normalized correlation prevents matches covering only a small
fraction of the matrix (e.g. matches between the last column of the
query matrix and the first column of the reference matrix, or matches
of a very small motif against a large one).

The normalization factor is the relative length (Wr), i.e. the number
of aligned columns divided by the total columns of the alignment.

Ncor = cor * Wr

This correction is particularly important to avoid selecting spurious
alignments between short fragments of the flanks of the matrices
(e.g. single-column alignments). For this reasons, I<Ncor> generally
gives a better estimation of motif similarity than I<cor>, and we
recommend it as similarity score.

Imposing a too stringent lower threshold on Ncor may however reduce
the sensitivity, and in particular prevent from detecting matches
between half-motifs (e.g. in the case of dimeric transcription factor
recognizing composite motifs).

=head3 Note

An alternative would be to use as normalizing factor the length of the
alignment (w) relative to the length of the shorter motif.

 Ncor = cor * w / min(w1,w2)

This however tends to favour matches between very short motifs (4-5
residues) which cover only a fraction of the query motif.

=head3 Ncor1, Ncor2

In addition to Ncor, we define separate normalized correlations relative
to w1 and w2 resp. 

Ncor1 = cor * w / w1

Ncor2 = cor * w / w2

=head2 Correlation of the information content (Icor)

Pearson's correlation computed on the information content matrices
(I1, I2) rather than on the frequencies.

 Icov = 1/n * SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w} (I1{i,j} - f1m) * (I2{i,j} - f2m)
 Iv1 = 1/n * SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w} (I1{i,j} - f1m)^2
 Iv2 = 1/n * SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w} (I2{i,j} - f2m)^2
 cor = Icov/ sqrt(Iv1*Iv2)

The I<Icor> score fixes a weakness of the I<cor> score and all
other other metrics above, which only take into account the residue
frequencies whilst ignoring the background frequencies.

A typical manifestation of this problem is that the I<cor> score
occasionally returns alignements between non-informative pieces of the
matrices , which appear flat on the aligned logos. The reason why
uninformative columns may have a good correlation is that, if both
matrices have the same compositional bias (for example 30%A, 20%C,
20%G and 30%T), they will be correlated. Consequently, the columns
reflecting the background will contribute to increase the correlation
coefficient.

The information content corrects this bias by relativizing the matrix
frequencies with respect to the background residue probaiblities.

 I{i,j} = f{i,j} log (f{i,j}/p{j})

where I<p{j}> is the prior probability of residue I<j>.

=pod

=item B<-nobuf>

No buffering.

By default, the Perl language holds the output in memory (buffering)
and writes output files piece by piece rather than line by line.

This creates a particlar problem when I<compare-matrices> is
encapsulated in another program (e.g. I<peak-footprints>), beacause
the script occasionally exits while the bufer is still being printed
out, and the output file is thus not yet ready for further analysis.

The option -nobuf turns off buffering. The printing out is probably
slower (the output stream is printed at each match), so we maintain
buffering by default.

=cut

    } elsif ($arg eq "-nobuf") {
      $main::no_buffering = 1;


=pod

=item B<-mode matches | profiles>

=over

=item I<-mode matches> (default)

Return matches between any matrix of the file1 and any matrix of
file2.

This is the typical use of I<compare-matrices>: comparing one or
several query motifs (e.g. obtained from motif discovery) with a
collection of reference motifs (e.f. a database of experimentally
characterized transcription factor binding motifs, such as JASPAR,
TRANSFAC, RegulonDB, ...).

For a given pair of matrices (one from file1 and one from file2), the
program tests all possible offsets, and measures one or several
matching scores (see section "(Dis)similarity metrics" above). The
program only returns the score of the best alignemnt between the two
matrices. The "best" alignement is the combination of offset and
strand (with the option -strand DR) that maximizes the default score
(Ncor). Alternative scores can be used as optimality criteria with the
option -sort.

=item I<-mode profiles>

Return a table with one row for each possible alignment offset between
two matrices, and various columns indicating the matching parameters
(offset, strand, aligned width,...), the matching scores, and the
consensus of the aligned columns of the matrices.

Matching profiles are convenient for drawing the similarity profiles,
or for analyzing the correlations between various similarity metrics,
but they are too verbosy for the typical use of I<compare-matrices>
(detect matches between a query matrix and a database of reference
matrices). The formats "matches" and "table" are more convenient for
basic use.

=pod

=item	B<-distinct>

Skip comparison between a matrix and itself.

This option is useful when the program is sused to compare all
matrices of a given file to all matrices of the same file, to avoid
comparing each matrix to itself.

Beware: the criterion for considering two matrices identical is that
they have the same identifier. If two matrices have exactly the same
content (in terms of occurrences per position) but different
identifiers, they will be compared.

=cut
    } elsif ($arg eq "-distinct") {
      $main::distinct = 1;


=pod

=item B<-strand D | R | DR>

Perform matrix comparisons in direct (D) reverse complementary (R) or
both orientations (DR, default option).

When the R or DR options are activated, all matrices of the second
matrix file are converted to the reverse complementary matrix.

This option is useful to answer very particular questions, for example

=over

=item Comparing motifs in a strand-insensitive way (-strand DR)

DNA-binding motifs are usually strand-insensitive. A motif may be
detected in one given orientation by a motif-discovery algorithm, but
annotated in the reverse complementary orientation in a motif
database. For DNA binding motifs, we thus recomment the DR option.

On the contrary, RNA-related signals (termination, poly-adenylation,
miRNA) are strand-sensitive, and should be compared in a single
orientation (-strand D).

=item Detecting reverse complementary palindromic motifs

An example of reverse complementary palindromic motif is
tCAGswwsGTGa. When a motif is reverse complementary palindromic, the
matrix is correlated to its own reverse complement.

I<Remark about a frequent misconception of biological palindromes>

Reverse complementary palindroms are frequent in DNA signals
(e.g. transcription factor binding sites, restriction sites, ...)
because they correspond to a rotational symmetry in the 3D
structure. Such symmetrical motifs are often characteristic of sites
recognized by homodimeric complexes.

By contrast, simple string-based palindromes (e.g. CAGTTGAC) do
absolutely not correspond to any symmetry on the biochemical point of
view, because the 3D structure of the corresponding double helix is
not symmetrical. The apparent symmetry is an artifact of the
string-based representation, but the corresponding molecule has
neither rotational nor translational symmetry.

DNA signals can either be symmetrical (reverse complementary
palindromes, tandem repeats) or asymmetrical.

Supported return fields:

=over

=item I<offset>

Offset (shift) between the two compared matrices.

=item I<cor>

Pearsons coefficient of correlatiojn. 

=item I<Ncor>

Normalized correlation (default sorting criterion for the matching
mode).

=item I<Ncor1>

Normalized correlation relative to w1.

=item I<Ncor2>

Normalized correlation relative to w2.

=item I<cov>

Covariance.

=item I<SSD>

Sum of squared distances. 

=item I<NSW>

Normalized Sandelin-Wasserman similarity.

=item I<SW>

Sandelin-Wasserman similarity.

=item I<dEucl>

Euclidian distance

=item I<NdEucl>

Normalized Euclidian distance.

=item I<NsEucl>

Normalized Euclidian similarity.

=item I<dKL>

Kullback-Leibler distance

=item I<matrix_number>

Number of the matrices in the input files

=item I<matrix_id>

Identifiers of the matrices

=item I<matrix_name>

Names of the matrices

=item I<matrix_ac>

Accession number of the matrices (TRANSFAC format makes a distinction
between IDs and accession numbers).

=item I<width>

Width of the matrices and the alignment

=item I<strand>

Direct (D) or Reverse complementary (R) comparison

=item I<offset>

Offset between the positions of the first and second matrix

=item I<pos>

Relative positions the aligned matrices (start, end, strand, width)

=item I<consensus>

Aligned consensus. The residues of the consensus corresponding to
aligned columns are displaye, non-aligned columns are replaced by
dots.

=item I<offset_rank>

During pairwise alignment, scores are computed for each offset and
offsets are sorted according to the sorting criterion. The offset_rank
indicates the rank of an offset in this sorted list. This is a
"within-alignment" rank, which is useful in profile mode.

=item I<match_rank>

and a mean rank is computed.

=item I<graph>

Return a matrix comparison graph where nodes correspond to matrices,
and edges represent similarities between pairs of matrices.

The graph is exported in GML (open with CytoScape or yet) and dot
(graphiviz) format.

An advantage if the GML and dot formats is that they include
disconnected nodes, in contrast with the tab-delimited matrix
comparison table.

=item I<alignments_pairwise>

Shifted matrices resulting from the pairwise alignments.

=item I<alignments_1ton>

Shifted matrices resulting from the 1-to-N alignments.

metric: ascending for dissimilarity metrics, decreasing for similarity
metrics.

Supported sort fields:

=item B<logoDP>

Dot product between the "sequence logo statisitcs", i.e. the
column-wise information content multiplied by the residue frequency.

=item B<Additional metrics>

=over

=item Mutual information

We should check if this fixes the problems of 0 values that we have
with the KL distance.

=item The "natural covariance"

Pape, U. J., Rahmann, S. and Vingron, M. (2008). Natural similarity
measures between position frequency matrices with an application to
clustering. Bioinformatics 24, 350-7.

This metrics measures the covariance between hits of two matrices
above a given threshold for each of them.

=item chi2 P-value (for the sake of comparison).

Note that a condition of applicability of the chi2 P-value is that the
expected value should be >= 5 for each cell of the matrix. This
condition is usually not fulfilled for the PSSM we use for motif
scanning.

=item Average Log Likelihood Ratio (ALLR)

=item I<-return crosstable field>

Export a table with one row per matrix of the file 1, one column per
matrix of file 2, where each cell indicates the value of the selected
field for the corresponding pair of matrices.

=item I<-return graph>

</h2>

<h4>Description</h4>
<ul>

    Compares a graph with a classification/clustering file.<br>

    The comparison is performed at the level of arcs: for each arc of the
    graph, the programs tests if the soure and target nodes are found in a
    common cluster (intra-cluster arcs) or in separate clusters
    (inter-cluster arcs).<br>

    In the cluster file, each node can be associated to one or several
    clusters. For example, the "cluster" file could contain the result of a
    classification such as ghe Gene Ontology (GO), where each gene can be
    associated to multiple GO classes.

<h4>Options</h4>
<ul>
<A NAME="formats"></A>
<h4>Input and output formats</h4>
  <ul><b>Graph format</b><br>
  The accepted input formats are GML, tab-delimited and adjacency matrix. 
  For more explanations about these, refer to the <a href = 'help.convert_graph.html'>manual of convert-graph</a>.
  <br><br>
  <b>Classification format</b><br>
   A two-column file with column corresponding respectively to the node name and to the cluster name.
   If the <i>induced</i> option is used. The classification file must only consist of a list of nodes, each node being 
   the first word of each line.
  </ul></ul>


<h4><A NAME="columns"></A>Column specifications (only for tab-delimited format)</h4>
<ul><A NAME="scol"></A><b>Source and target column</b>. Columns containing the source and target nodes. </ul>
<ul><A NAME="wcol"></A><b>Weight or label column</b>. Column containing the weight or the label on the edge. </ul>
</ul></ul>
<h4><A NAME="output"></a>Results</h4>
  <ul><b>Annotated graph</b><br>
Each row corresponds to one arc, identified by its source and target
nodes, and with additional columns for the annotations, indicating
the status of each arc (intra- or inter-cluster), plus some
statistics about the clusters associated to the source and target
nodes. Extra-columns are documented in the header of the file.  <br><br>
  <b>Graph</b><br>
A list of intra-cluster edges in the requested format. The intra-cluster edges belonging 
to different classification are colored differently<br><br>
  <b>Node cluster connection table</b><br>
A tab-delimited file where each row represents a node of the graph,
and each column a cluster (class). The cells indicate the number of
arcs connecting each node to each cluster (class) (or the sum of the
weights on the edges).

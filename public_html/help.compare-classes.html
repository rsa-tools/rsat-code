<h4>Description</h4>
<ul>

Compare two class files (the query file and the reference file). Each
class of the query file is compared to each class of the reference
file. The number of common elements is reported, as well as the
probability to observe at least this number of common elements by
chance alone.

<h4>Authors</h4>

<b>Warning</b>: the following text is the help message from the
on-line program, we still need to format it for the html form. There
re possibly some differencs in option names, but the help already
provides information about the statistics used by the program, and the
meaning of the different options.

<PRE>
        -r ref_classes
        		A tab-delimited text file containing the dscription of
        		reference classes (see format description below).
        		
        -q query_classes
        		A tab-delimited text file containing the dscription of
        		query classes (see format description below).

    	-i input_file
      		  	This file will be used as both reference and query. 
     		  	This is equivalent to 
         	   	-q input_file -r input_file

   	 	-sc score column
        		Specify a column of the input file containing a score associated to
       			each member. The score is used for some metrics like the dot product.

    	-o outputfile
        		if not specified, the standard output is used.
        		This allows to place the command within a pipe.

    	-rnames class_name_file
        		File containing names for the reference classes.
        		Associate a name to each class, when the classes are
        		specified by an ID (ex Gene Ontology term IDs).  
        		The class name file contains two columns

            	1) class ID
            	2) class name


    	-qnames class_name_file
        		File containing names for the query classes.

       	-cat catalog
        		Compare the query file to pre-defined catalogs
        		(e.g. GO, MIPS functional classes, ...). These
        		catalogs associate each gene of a genome to one or
        		several classes.  The organism must be specified
        		(option -org).
        
        		Supported catalogs:

        		The differences between these four options are

PROBABILITIES

    P-VALUE

        The P-value is the probability for one comparison to return a
        false positive. In other words, it is the probability to
        observe at least c common elements between a given query class
        and a given reference class. It can be calculated with
        different formulae, depending on the underlying random model.

        Let us assume that we have :
                q       size of the query class
                r       size of the reference class
                c       number of common elements
                n       population size

    HYPERGEOMETRIC
                       q     i  q-i     q
        P_value = P(X >= c) = SUM ( C  C     / C  )
                      i=c    r  n-r     n

    BINOMIAL

        When the option -rep (replacement) is active,
        probabilities are calculated on the basis of the
        binomial distribution instead of the hypergeometric.


        The binomial formula is applied with
                p_r = r/n probability of success at each trial
                nb of trials = q
                nb of successes = c

                       q
        P_value = P(X >= c) = SUM (binom(i,q,p_r))
                      i=c

        Beware: the binomial gives an assymmetric result,
        i.e. the fact to swap query and reference classes
        changes the probability. This can be circumvented by
        using the option -sym, described below.

    SYMMETRICAL COMPARISON WITH THE BINOMIAL

        When the comparison is assumed to be symmetrical, the
        program calculates the joint probability fo at least c
        elements to belong to both the query set and the
        reference set.

        In this case, the binomial is applied with :
                p_qr = q/n * r/n
                  = proba of success at each trial
                nb of trials = n
                nb of successes = c

                       q
        P_value = P(X >= c) = SUM (binom(i,n,p_qr))
                      i=c

    E-VALUE

        Assuming that there are x query classes and y
        reference classes, each analysis consists in x*y
        comparisons. Thus, the P-value can be misleading,
        because even low P-values are expected to emerge by
        chance alone when the number of query and/or reference
        classes is very high. The E-value reflects better the
        degree of exceptionality.

        The option -multi_cor allows to choose among 4
        possible multi-testing correction factors. The choice
        is left to the user, depending on the question he/she
        wants to answer.

        -multi_cor nr

            How many false positives do we expect per query
            class ?

                E-value = P-value * nr

            Where nr is the number of reference classes
            (e.g. the number of classes in the GO
            classification).

        -multi_cor nq

            How many false positives do we expect per
            reference class ?

                E-value = P-value * nq

            Where nq is the number of query classes
            (e.g. the number of co-expression cluster).


        -multi_cor nc

            How many false positives do we expect for the
            whole set of comparisons ?

                nc = nq * nr
                E-value = P-value * nc

            Where nc is the number of comparisons between a
            query class and a reference class.


        -multi_cor nt
            How many false positives do we expect for the
            whole set of significance tests actually
            performed ?

                  E-value = P-value * nt

            where nt is the number of significance tests
            actually performed (the number of times the
            hypergeometric or binomial formula was used)

        If you do not use any "pre-filtering" threshold, the
        options nc and nt give the same result (nt = nq * nr),
        since a significance test is performed for each pair
        of query class - reference class.

        If you use pre-filtering thresholds (for example -lth occ 1,
        to select only the pairs with at least one common member), the
        actual number of tests can in some cases be much smaller than
        the number of comparisons (nt <= nc = nq*nr).

    SIG

        The significance index is the minus log of the
        E-value. It is calculated in base 10.

        sig = -log10(E_val)

        This index gives an intuitive perception of the
        exceptionality of the common elements : a negative sig
        indicates that the common matches are likely to come by
        chanc alone, a ositive value that they are
        significant. Higher sig values indicate a higher
        significance.

OUTPUT FORMAT

        The program returns a tabdelimited file with one row per
        combination of reference-query class, and one column per
        return field.

        Default return fields:
        1) ref      reference class
        2) query    query class
        3) ref#     number of members in the ref class
        4) query#   number of members in the query class
        5) common   number of elements in common between the query 
                    and reference class

        Additional return values are optionally returned, and can be
        specified with the -return option.

FILE FORMATS
    CLASS FILE
        The class file specifies the composition of several gene
        families.  It is a text file containing 2 columns separated by
        a tab character.

            col 1:   class member
            col 2:   class name

        Additional columns are ignored. 

        Lines starting with a semicolumn (;) are ignored, allowing to
        document the class files with comments.

        A given element (e.g. gene) can belong simultaneously to
        several families. In such a case, the element will appear on
        several rows (one per class),

        Example
                ; genes responding to Phosphate stress
                pho5    PHO
                pho8    PHO
                ; genes responding to nitrogen starvation
                DAL5    NIT
                GAP1    NIT
                ...

<H2>Description</H2>
<UL>

Detects overrepresented spaced dyads in a set of DNA sequences. A dyad
is a pair of oligonucleotides of the same size. They can be separated
by a fixed number of bases. <P>

This algorithm detects a set of binding sites that is not detected by
oligo-analysis, because of the variability within the spacer region. A
typical example of patterns that are efficiently detected by the dyad
analysis is the binding site for the yeast Gal4p transcription factor,
which has the consensus <TT><B>CGGNNNNNWNNNNNCCG</B></TT>.<P>

<H2>Options</H2>
<UL>

<P>
<A NAME="title"></A><h4>Title</H4>
(facultative)<BR>

Title of the data set. This information is returned as title of the
result page.<P>

<P>
<A NAME="sequence"></A>
<H4>Input sequence:</H4>

The sequence that will be analyzed. Multiple sequences can be entered
at once with several <a href=help.formats.html>sequence formats</a>.

<P>
<A NAME="sequence_format"></A>
<H4>Format:</H4>

Input sequence format. <a href=help.formats.html>Various standards</a>
are supported.

<P>
<A NAME="purge"></A>
<H4>Purge sequences (highly recommended)</H4> When checked,
large duplicated regions (>= 40 bp alignment with less than 3
mismatches)) are filtered out before analysis. Purging is essential
for any motif discovery process, to avoid a bias due to
non-independence of sequences. Purging is performed with the programs
<TT>mkvtree</TT> and <TT>vmatch</TT> developed by <a
href=http://www.zbh.uni-hamburg.de/kurtz>Stefan Kurtz</a> (<a
href="mailto:kurtz@zbh.uni-hamburg.de">kurtz@zbh.uni-hamburg.de</a>).


<P>

<A NAME="oligo_size"></A>
<H4>Oligonucleotide size</H4>
This is the size of a single element (a half dyade). 

<P>
<A NAME="spacing"></A>
<H4>Spacing</H4>

Spacing between the elements of the dyad. The spacing is the number of
bases between the end of the fisrt element and the start of the second
one. <P>

A single integer value means that the spacing is fixed. Variable
spacing can be introdued by entering the min and max values separated
by a hyphen. For example 8-12 means that all occurrences of the dyad
with a spacing between 8 and 12 qill be counted together and their
significance estimated globally. Warning, this is different from
scanning one by one th spacing values 8 to 12.

<P>
<A NAME="dyad_type"></A>
<H4>Dyad type</H4>

In order to fasten execution, the program can be asked to restrict its
analysis to symmetric dyads, with 3 possibilities : <BR>

<UL>

<LI><B>direct repeats</B>: the second element is the same as the first
one

<LI><B>inverted repeats</B>: the second element is the reverse
complement of the first one.

<LI><B>any repeat</B>: analyse both direct and inverted repeats
</UL>

<BR>
When selecting the option <B>any dyad</B>, the analysis is performed
on all dyads, symmetric as well as non-symmetric.  <B>Warning</B>: the
number of dyads increases dramatically with this option, and it should
not be used for elements widers than 3 nucleotides.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="count_strands"></A>
<H4>Count on:</H4> (single or both strands)<BR> By selecting "both
strands", the occurrences of each oligonucleotide are summed on both
strands. This allows to detect elements which act in an
orientation-insensitive way (as is generally the case for yeast
upstream elements). <P>

<P>
<A NAME="noov"></A> 
<h4>Prevent overlapping matches</h4>

Periodic patterns (e.g. AAAn{0}AAA, TATn{1}TAT) have an aggregative tendency,
i.e. each occurrence of such a pattern strongly favours additional
occurrences in its immediate vicinity. This introduces a bias to most
statistics (binomial, log-likelihood). A simple way to correct for
this bias is to prevent counting twice mutually overlapping
occurrences. <BR>

For example, the string <TT>AAAAAAAAAAAAAA</TT> would represent
<UL>
<LI>7 occurrences of <TT>AAAn{1}AAA</TT> when self-overlap is allowed
<LI>2 occurrences of <TT>AAAn{1}AAA</TT> when self-overlap is prevented
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="exp_freq"></A>
<H4>Expected frequency calibration</H4> 
<ul>
<h5>Background model</h5>

Compare dyad frequencies observed in the query sequence to those of a
reference sequence (the background model). 

<P>
Pre-calculted tables are used to estimate expected oligonucleotide
frequencies (background frequencies). These tables were obtained by
counting all dyad frequencies (monad size 3, spacing from 0 to 20) in
different sequence types, and this for each organism.

<ul>
<li><b>upstream</b>: all upstream regions, allowing overlap with
upstream ORFs.

<li><b>upstream-noorf</b>: all upstream regions, preventing overlap
with upstream ORFs (sequences are clipped to discard upstream ORF
sequences).

<!--
<li><b>intergenic</b>: all the intergenic regions, including upstream
and downstream sequences.
-->
</ul>


<P>
<h5>Monad frequencies from the input sequence</h5>
The frequency expected for each dyad is the product of the frequency
observed expected for each monad (oligonucleotide) in the sequence file.

<PRE>
	exp(dyad) = exp(oligo1)*exp(oligo2)
</PRE>

</ul>

<P>
<A NAME="threshold"></A> 
<H4>Threshold of significance:</H4>
<BR> Thresholds can be imposed to select the most significantly
overrepresented patterns. A threshold of 0 on occurrence significance
index is selected by default. This is the most efficient way we found
to automatically select the biologicaly significant regulatory sites,
irrespective of oligonucleotide size, number and size of the sequences
in the input set.
<P>

</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="return"></A>
<H3>Output columns</H3>
<UL>

<LI><B>Expected frequency (exp_frq):</B> the probability to observe
the dyad at each position. This value is calculated on basis of the
expected frequency table (see below).

<LI><B>Observed occurrences (obs_occ):</B> the number of ocurrences
observed for each dyad. Overlapping matches are detected and summed in
the counting.

<LI><B>Expected number of occurrences (exp_occ):</B> the number of
ocurrences expected for each dyad. This value is calculated on basis
of the oligonucleotide frequency table selected.

<LI><B>Occurrence probability (occ_pro):</B> the probability to have N
or more occurrences, given the expected number of occurrences (where N
is the observed number of occurrences).

<LI><B>Occurrence Significance (occ_sig):</B> this is a conversion of
the occurrence probability, taking into account the number of possible
dyads (which varies with oligo size) and doing a logarithmic
transformation. The highest sig correspond to the most overrepresented
oligonucleotide. Sig value higher than 0 indicate overrepresentation.

<A NAME="proba"></A>
<H3>Probabilities</H3>
<UL>

Various calibration models can be used to estimate the probability of
each oligonucleotide (see above). From there, and expected number of
occurrences is calculated and compared to the observed number of
occurrences. The significance of the observed number of occurrences is
calculated with the binomial formulae.

<PRE>	
    EXPECTED DYAD FREQUENCY
	If exp(oligo1) is the expected frequency for the first element, and
	   exp(oligo1) is the expected frequency for the second element
	
	Then
	   exp(dyad) = exp(oligo1)*exp(oligo2)

    NUMBER OF POSSIBLE DYADS
	This number depends on the dyad type selected by the user. 
	When the analysis is restricted to inverted repeats, or to direct 
	repeats, the first element univocally determines the second one, 
	thus:
		nb_poss_dyads = nb_poss_oligo
		              = 4^w
		where w is the oligonucleotide length.

	When any dyad is allowed, each oligonucleotide can combine with any 
	other or itself, thus:
		nb_poss_dyads = nb_poss_oligo * nb_poss_oligo 
		              = 4^2w


    EXPECTED OCCURRENCES
	                      r
	   Exp_occ = p * 2 * SUM (Lj + 1 - d) = p * T
	                     j=1
	
	where	p  = expected dyad frequency
		n  = number of input sequences
		Lj = length of the jth input sequence
		d  = length of the dyad, calculated as follows:
			d = 2w + s
			where w is the oligonucleotide length
			      s is the spacer length
                T  = the number of possible matching positions in the 
		     whole set of input sequences.

		The factor 2 stands for the fact that occurrences are summed
		on both strands (it is omitted when the option -1str 
                is active).

    PROBABILITY OF THE OBSERVED NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES
	
	The probability to observe exactly obs occurrences in the whole set
  	of sequences is calculated by the binomial
	
	                                              obs      T-obs
	    P(obs) = bin(p,T,obs) =       T!         p    (1-p)
                                     ---------------
                                     obs! * (T-obs)! 
	
	where   obs is the observed number of dyad occurrences,
                p   is the expected dyad frequency,
                T   is the number of possible matching positions,
                    as defined above. 
	
	The probability to observe obs or more occurrences in the whole set of
  	of sequences is calculated by the sum of binomials:
	
	                    obs-1
	    P(>=obs) =  1 - SUM P(j)
	                    j=0
	                        
    SIGNIFICANCE INDEX
        The significance index is a conversion of the occurrence probability, 
	calculated as follows:.
	
	      Sig_occ = -log10(NPD * P(>=obs));

	where	NPD	is the number of possible dyads, calculated as above.

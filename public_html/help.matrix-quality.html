<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>Evaluate the quality of a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM), by
comparing score distributions obtained with this matrix in various
sequence sets.</p>
<p>The most classical use of the program is to compare score
distributions between &quot;positive&quot; sequences (e.g. true binding sites
for the considered transcription factor) and &quot;negative&quot; sequences
(e.g. intergenic sequences between convergently transcribed genes).</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="positive_set___annotated_binding_sites">Positive set : annotated binding sites</a></h2>
<p>The typical positive set is a collection of sites that have been shown
(with experimental methods) to bind the transcription factor of
interest.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="matrix_sites">Matrix sites</a></h2>
<p>A particular case of postive control is to estimate the distribution
of scores of the sites that served to build the matrix. This however
provkes some bias (over-estimation of the scores), since the matrix is
used to score the sites on which it was &quot;trained&quot;. This bias can be
circumvented by applying a cross-validation.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="cross_validation">Cross-validation</a></h2>
<p>An important bias of evaluation (and a frequent trap in published
articles) can result from an over-fitting of the matrix to the
positive set, in case one would use the same sites for building the
PSSM and for evaluating it. To avoid this bias, <em>matrix-quality</em>
supports two modes of cross-validation (CV):</p>
<pre>
 1. Leave-one-out (LOO)
 2. k-fold cross-validation (kfold)</pre>
<p>The cross-validation can only be performed when the matrix is
specified in a format that includes both the matrix and the sites
(sequences) that were used to build this matrix. This is the case for
matrices in MEME, consensus, transfac and MotifSampler formats.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="k_fold_cross_validation">k-fold cross-validation</a></h3>
<p>The set of input sequence (matrix site sequences) is partitionned into
k randomly selected subets of approx. equal size (the number of sites
is not always an exact multiple of k).</p>
<p>The program then iterates over the testing set in the following
way. All the sites that are not part of the testing sets are used as
trianing sites to build a partial matrix. The testing sites are then
scored with this partial matrix.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="leave_one_out__loo__test">Leave-One-Out (LOO) test</a></h3>
<p>In LOO cross-validation mode, one sequence (the &quot;left-out sequence&quot;)
is temporarily discarded from the positive set, and the remaining
sequences are used to build a matrix, which is then used to score the
left out sequence. The process iterates over all the sequences of the
positive set.</p>
<p>If the left-out sequence has one or more &quot;twin&quot; (identical site) in
the positive set, they are also temporarily excluded from the positive
set and not included in the matrix used to score the left out
sequence.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="loo_or_k_fold_">LOO or k-fold ?</a></h3>
<p>The LOO is actually a particular case of k-fold cross-validation,
where k equals the total number of sites used to build the original
matrix. The LOO is particularly adapted for matrices built from a very
small number of sites (e.g. matrices built from a handful of
well-documented sites as usually found in transcription factor
databases).</p>
<p>On the contrary, the k-fold cross-validation is useful to save
computing time for matrices built from large collection of sites
(e.g. thousands of sites resulting from ChIP-seq experiments).</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="negative_set">Negative set</a></h2>
<p>It is sometimes difficult to find a good negative set, i.e. a
collection of sequences which supposedly do not contain any binding
site for the transcription factor of interest.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="random_selection_of_biological_sequences">Random selection of biological sequences</a></h3>
<p>One possibility is to select a random set of genome fragments
(e.g. use <em>random-genes</em> to select promoters of 100 randomly selected
genes). However, some of these randomly selected sequences might
contain effective binding sites for the transcripton factor.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="artificial_sequences">Artificial sequences</a></h3>
<p>Another possiblity is to generate artificial sequences according to
some background model (uing <em>random-seq</em>), but there is always a risk
that for model to be an over-simplification of the real sequences.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="biological_sequences_scanned_with_column_permuted_matrices">Biological sequences scanned with column-permuted matrices</a></h3>
<p>Yet another approach to perform the negative test os to scan
biological sequences (e.g. upstream regions of 100 randomly picked
genes) with column-permuted matrices. The advantage of this approach
is that the sequences are realistic, but the permuted matrices
hopefully do not correspond to any actual motif, and their empirical
distribution observed in the test sequences is thus supposed to fit
the theoretcial distribution.</p>
<p>This approach may however pose problem in the specific case of
weak-complexity motifs (e.g. CCGCCC, AATTTT), since many permutations
will give motifs that are similar, if not equal, to the original
motif.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="how_to_use_this_program_">HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM ?</a></h1>
<p>Let us be frank, this program can do many things, but requires a bit
of expertise. A good strategy to get familiar with its multiple
results is to start runing the simplest possible analysis, and
progressively adding the more advanced tasks.</p>
<p>We propose hereafter a step-by-step schedule of utilization, where
subsequent tasks are progressively added.</p>
<p>We assume here that the user disposes of a PSSM in a format that
includes both the matrix and the aligned sites used to compute the
matrix (e.g. MEME format). Beware, the sites actually incorporated in
the matrix may differ frfom the collection of sites used as input for
the matrix-building program. For instance, if you use MEME (with the
option -zoops) to build a matrix from a collection of annotated TFBS,
some sites may be incorporated in the matrix, and some other
skipped. We use hereafter the expression <strong>&quot;matrix sites&quot;</strong> to refer to
the sites used in the alignment from which the residues frequencies of
the matrix were computed.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="comparing_the_scores_of_the_matrix_sites_to_the_theoretical_distribution">Comparing the scores of the matrix sites to the theoretical
distribution</a></h2>
<pre>
 matrix-quality -v 1 -ms my_matrix.meme -matrix_format meme \
   -no_cv -perm matrix_sites 0 -bgfile my_background.txt \
   -o my_matrix_quality</pre>
<p>This will produce the simplest possible analysis: computing the score
distribution of the matrix sites, and comparing it to the theoretical
distribution.</p>
<p>Beware: the score distribution of matrix sites is fake. Indeed, those
are the very stes that were used to build the matrix. Each site partly
contributed to the matrix scores (weights) that will serve to score
it. There is thus a problem of over-fitting: we train a matrix with
some data, and we evaluate the matrix with the same data.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="assessing_matrix_sites_with_a_leave_one_out__loo__procedure">Assessing matrix sites with a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure</a></h2>
<p>To circumvent the problem of over-fitting mentioned above, we have
need to perform the Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure. Actually,
<em>matrix-scan</em> automatically runs the leave-one-out test by
default. The reason why it was not done in the previous section is
because we used the option -no_cv, for the only purpose of
illustrating the problem of overfitting. We will now run
<em>matrix-scan</em> in the normal way, without inactivating the LOO
procedure.</p>
<pre>
 matrix-quality -v 1 -ms my_matrix.meme -matrix_format meme \
   -perm matrix_sites 0 -bgfile my_background.txt \
   -o my_matrix_quality</pre>

<p><em>matrix-distrib</em> requires to specify a background model, which will
be passed to <em>matrix-distrib</em> and <em>matrix-scan</em>. This background model
can be specified with the same options as for <em>matrix-scan</em>.</p>

<p>All the other options are automatically passed to <em>matrix-scan</em>, in
order to specify the scanning parameters (strands, background model,
...).</p>
<p>Note that the option '-return' of matrix-scan cannot be used here,
because matrix-quality specifies the return fields required for its
statistics.</p>
<p>If the option '-bgfile' is specified, the specified background model
will be used to calculate the matrix theorical distribution. If
another type of background model is specified for matrix-scan
('-bginput' or '-window'), use '-th_prior' option to specify the
background model to be used for the calculation of the matrix
theorical distribution.</p>

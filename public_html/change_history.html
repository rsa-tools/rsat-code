The change history is now available through the <b>RSAT Forum</b>. <br/>
New changes will be posted in the <a href="http://www.bigre.ulb.ac.be/forums/viewforum.php?f=25&start=0&sid=f5414c33b7cde073f7c4e0b5b45f3de2"> Announcement section</a>.

<P>
The Regulatory Sequence Analysis tools are evolving regularly. We only
summarize here the main steps in this evolution.  

<ul>
<li>This summary only started in September 2002 (although the tools
exist since 1997). 
<li>In addition, it only mention important changes, and we occasionally
forget to report some modification.
</ul>
<p>

An exhaustive list of modifications for all the tools (including those
anterior to September 2002) is maintained in our CVS server. It can be
obtained on request by sending an email to

<i><pre>
  E-value = P-value * nb_possible_patterns

The E-value is now calculated according to the number of patterns
really tested for significance (i.e. after filtering on occurrences,
frequencies, ...).

<i><pre>
  E-value = P-value * nb_tested_patterns
</pre></i>


<p>In most cases it should not make any difference with previous
results, but for small sequence sets (< 10000bp) or large patterns (>
6nt), the previous correction was too severe, resulting in a loss of
sensitivity.

<tr valign=top>
<td>2005/06/12</td>
<td><a href=dyad-analysis_form.cgi>dyad-analysis</a></td>
<td><li>Changed the counting mode when counting on boths
strands. Instead of considering the 2 strands as two independent
sequences with T=2*(L-k+1) possible positions for D dyads, I consider
pairs of reverse-complementary dyads as the single event, and the
number of possible positions for any of the pairs (direct or RC dyad)
is T=L-k+1. 
<p>Occurrence counts remain unchanged, except for the
revere-palindromic dyads, which appear twice less frequent (they are
noww "seen" on a single strand.
<p>Probabilities were adapted accordingly. For non-reverse-plindromic
dyads, this can slightly change the calucated P-values. for reverse
complementary palindromic dyads, it does not change anything , since
the P-value were already calculated this way.

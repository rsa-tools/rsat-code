Introduction
</h2></center>

<P>
The release of complete genomic sequences not only offered a huge
amount of new data for the molecular biologist, but also impulsed the
development of new computational techniques required for the analysis
of these data.

<P>
Most informatic tools currently available were conceived essentially
for the analysis of coding sequences.  Non-coding sequences present
however a striking interest since they govern the regulation of gene
expression.

<P>
This site offers a series of tools dedicated to the detection of
regulatory signals in non-coding sequences. The only input required is
a list of genes of interest (e.g. a family of co-regulated
genes). From this information, you can retrieve the upstream sequences
over a desired distance, discover putative regulatory signals, search
the matching positions for these signals in your original dataset or
in whole genomes, and display the results graphically in the form of a
feature map.


<P>
Each tool is presented as a form to fill. For each form, a manual page
provides detailed information about the parameters. To get familiar
with the tools, we recommend you to follow the <B><A

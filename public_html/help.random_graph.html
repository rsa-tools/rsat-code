<h4>Description</h4>
<ul>

<h4>Options</h4><ul>
<A NAME="formats"></A>

<h4>Input and output formats</h4>

  The accepted input formats are GML, tab-delimited and adjacency
  matrix.  For more explanations about these, refer to the <a href =
  'help.convert_graph.html'>manual of convert-graph</a>.
</ul>


<h4><A NAME="columns"></A>Column specifications (only for tab-delimited format)</h4>

<ul><A NAME="scol"></A><b>Source and target column</b>. Columns
containing the source and target nodes. </ul>

<ul><A NAME="wcol"></A><b>Weight or label column</b> Column containing
the weight or the label on the edge. </ul>

</ul>
<h4><A NAME="directed"></A>Directed graph</h4>

    <ul>Specifies whether the graph must be considered as directed,
        i.e., an edge from node A to node B is different from an edge
        from B to A (by default, the graph is considered as non-directed).</ul>

</ul>
<h4><A NAME="random_type"></A>Randomization type</h4>

     <ul><b>From scratch</b>, builds a graph totally by creating a
	given number of nodes and throwing a given number of edges
	between them, each node having the same probability to be
	selected as source or target of each edge.

        The user may specify nodes names by providing an input graph
        file. The edges are generated using the Erdos-Renyi
        distribution. You may compute edge weight values by specifying
        a mean and a standard deviation. Weight will be attributed
        according to the normal distribution.</ul>

       <ul><b>ER (Erdos-Renyii randomization)</b>, corresponds to the
        randomization of a input graph, keeping the original nodes and
        the number of edges. ER randomization does not preserve
        topologivcal properties such as node degree, clustering
        coefficient, .... 

     <br>If you specify a weight column for the input graph, the
        weights of the output graph will be randomly assigned to the
        edges.

     <br>By using the <i>normal distribution option</i>, the edge
        weights will be computed following the normal distribution
        (considering the weight distribution of the original
        graph). If nor the weight column is specified nor the wished
        mean and standard deviation of the weights of the edges of the
        output graph, no weight will be added.</ul>

    <ul>With the <b>node degree conservation</b> randomization type,
        each node will keep the same degree as in the input graph
        (edge randomization).</ul>

    <ul>With the <b>node degree distribution conservation</b>
        randomization type, the global distribution of node degrees
        remains the same as in the input graph, but the degree of
        individual nodes has not to be preserved.</ul>
        

<h4><A NAME="duplicate"></A>Duplicated edges allowed</h4>
   
   <ul>Specifies whether more than one edge may link two nodes. (by
        default, duplicated edges are not allowed.</ul>

<h4><A NAME="self"></A>Self loops allowed</h4>
   
   <ul>Specifies whether self loops are allowed. (by
        default, self-loops are not allowed.</ul>

<h4><A NAME="no_single"></A>No single node (only for ER randomization type)</h4>

<ul>Prevent the ER graph from containing nodes with no neighbour</ul>

<h4><A NAME="col_conservation"></A>Column conservation (only for
  tab-delimited input and ER randomization type)</h4>

<ul>Only compatible with ER randomization of a graph. Source and
        target nodes stay source and target nodes in the randomized
        graph.</ul>

<h4><A NAME="normal"></A>Normal</h4>

<ul>This option can only be used with ER and from scratch
        randomization types and if the input graph is weighted. Using
        this option will generate randomly the weight of the output
        random graph according to a normal distribution of
        weights. The mean and standard deviation can then be chosen
        (-mean and -sd option) or will be calculated according to the
        weights the input graph.

</ul><h4><A NAME="mean"></A>Mean</h4>

<ul>Mean value on the weight of the arcs. This argument can only be
        used with the scratch and ER randomization type and must be
        combined with the <i>standard deviation</i> option
</ul>

</ul><h4><A NAME="sd"></A>Standard deviation</h4>

<ul>Standard deviation value of the weight of the arcs. This argument
        can only be used with the scratch and ER randomization type
        and must be combined with the <i>mean</i> option.
</ul>

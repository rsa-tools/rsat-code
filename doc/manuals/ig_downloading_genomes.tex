\section{Downloading genomes}
\label{downloading_genomes}

\RSAT includes a series of tools to install and maintain the latest
version of genomes.

\subsection{Original data sources}

Genomes supported on \RSAT were obtained from various sources.

Genomes can be installed either from the \RSAT web site, or from their
original sources.  

\begin{itemize}
\item NCBI/Genbank (\url{ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/})

\item ENSEMBL (\url{http://www.ensembl.org/})

\item The EBI genome directory (\url{ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/genomes/Eukaryota/})

\end{itemize}

Other genomes can also be found on the web site of a diversity of
genome-sequencing centers.

\subsection{Requirement : wget}

The download of genomes relies on the application \program{wget},
which is part of linux distribution. \program{wget} is a ``web
aspirator'', which allows to downlaod whole directories from ftp and
http sites. You can check if the program is installed on your machine.

\begin{verbatim}
wget -help
\end{verbatim}

This command should return the help pages for \program{wget}.  If you
obtain an error message (``command not found''), you need to ask your
system administrator to install it.

\subsection{Importing organisms from the \RSAT main server}

The simplest way to install organisms on our \RSAT site is to download
the RSAT-formatted files from the web server. For this, you can use a
web aspirator (for example the program \program{wget}). 

Beware, the full installation (including Mammals) requires a large
disk space (several dozens of Gb). You should better start installting
a small genome and test it before processing to the full
installation. We illustrate the approach with the genome of our
preferred model organism: the yeast \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}.

\subsubsection{Importing a single organism}

The makefile script \file{makefiles\/init\_RSAT.mk} includes a target to
install and configure a single organism on your RSAT site. 

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
cd $RSAT

# Download a single genome from the RSAT web server. 
# This requires the program wget.
make -f makefiles/init_RSAT.mk download_one_genome ORG=Saccharomyces_cerevisiae

# Declare the newly downlaoded genome as a supported organism
make -f makefiles/init_RSAT.mk configure_one_genome ORG=Saccharomyces_cerevisiae

\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

You can now check if the configuration file has been correctly updated
by typing the command.

\begin{verbatim}
supported-organisms
\end{verbatim}

In principle, the following information should be displayed on your
terminal.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
    Saccharomyces_cerevisiae   Saccharomyces cerevisiae
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\subsubsection{Importing another organism}

You can now proceed exactly in th same way to install any organism of
your choice. For example, if you want to install Escherichia coli K12?
you can run the ffollowing commands.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
cd \$RSAT

# Download a single genome from the RSAT web server. 
# This requires the program wget.
make -f makefiles/init_RSAT.mk download_one_genome ORG=Escherichia_coli_K12

# Declare the newly downlaoded genome as a supported organism
make -f makefiles/init_RSAT.mk configure_one_genome ORG=Escherichia_coli_K12

## Check that the new genome has bee added to the list of supported organisms
supported-organisms
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

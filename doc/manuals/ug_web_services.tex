%% Running Web Services with RSAT

\chapter{Using RSAT Web Services}

Note: in complement of the following instructions, we recommend to run
the protocol for using \RSAT Web services \cite{Sand:2009}.

\section{Introduction}

\RSAT facilities can be used as Web Services (\concept{WS}),
i.e. external developers (you) can integrate \RSAT methods in their
own code. An important advantage of Web Services is that they are
using a standard communication interface between client and server
(e.g. WSDL/SOAP), for which libraries exist in various languages
(Perl, Python, java).

We explain below how to implement WS clients in Perl, Java and Python for \RSAT
programs.

\section{Examples of WS clients in Perl with SOAP::WSDL 2.00 (or above)}

\subsection{Requirements}

Before using such WS clients, You need to install the
\program{Module::Build::Compat} and the \program{SOAP::WSDL} Perl
modules. These Perl modules can be installed with the program
\program{cpan}. When required, you will be prompted to install
dependency modules for \program{SOAP::WSDL}. For all this you need
root privileges. If this is not your case, please ask your system
administrator to install them for you.

The other thing you need is the RSATWS library that you can download
from the following website:

\small{\url{http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/web\_services/RSATWS.tar.gz}}

Place it in the same directory as your clients, then uncompress if
with the following command.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
tar -xpzf RSATWS.tar.gz
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}


\subsection{Retrieving sequences from RSATWS}

The following example is a script to retrieve the start codons of
three Escherichia coli genes. It uses \program{retrieve-seq} to do
so. The various parameters are passed as a hash table to the
method. If there is an error, it will be displayed, otherwise the
result is displayed, toghether with the full command generated on the
server and the name of the temporary file created on the server to
hold the result localy. This file is useful when one wants to feed
another program with that output, whithout paying the cost of a
useless data transport back and forth between the server and the
client.

}

\section{Examples of WS clients in Perl with SOAP::WSDL 1.27 (or below)}

Some of you are maybe already using perl WS clients with an older
version of \program{SOAP::WSDL} and would like to stick to it. We show
hereafter some simple examples of clients written in perl and using
such version of the module. The presented code as well as other can be
downloaded from

\small{\url{http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/web\_services.html}}

\subsection{Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item \program{SOAP::Lite}
\item \program{SOAP::WSDL}, version 1.27 or below.
\end{itemize}

These Perl modules can be installed with the program \program{cpan},
but for this you need root privileges. If this is not your case,
please ask your system administrator to install them for you.

\subsection{Getting gene-info from RSATWS}

The following script allows to get information about three
\org{Escherichia coli} genes from \RSAT. The client script passes
through the web service to run the \program{gene-info} on the
server. A list of genes is provided to the server, which returns the
information about those genes.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
# gene-info_client_minimal_soap-wsdl.pl - Client gene-info using the SOAP::WSDL module.

################################################################
##
## This script runs a simple demo of the web service interface to the
## RSAT tool gene-info. It sends a list of 3 gene names to the server, 
## in order to obtain the information about these genes. 
##
################################################################

use strict;
use SOAP::WSDL;

## Service location
my $server = 'http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/web_services';
my $WSDL = $server.'/RSATWS.wsdl';
my $proxy = $server.'/RSATWS.cgi';

## Call the service
my $soap=SOAP::WSDL->new(wsdl => $WSDL)->proxy($proxy);
$soap->wsdlinit;

## Gene-info parameters
my $organism = 'Escherichia_coli_K12';  ## Name of the query organism
my @gene = ("metA", "metB", "metC");  ## List of query genes
my $full = 1;  ## Looking for full match, not substring match.

my %args = ('organism' => $organism,
	    'query' => \@gene,
	    'full' => $full);

## Send the request to the server
warn "Sending request to the server $server\n";
my $call = $soap->call('gene_info' => 'request' => \%args);

## Get the result
if ($call->fault){ ## Report error if any
    printf "A fault (%s) occured: %s\n", $call->faultcode, $call->faultstring;
} else {
    my $results_ref = $call->result;  ## A reference to the result hash table
    my %results = %$results_ref;  ## Dereference the result hash table

    ## Report the remote command
    my $command = $results{'command'};
    print "Command used on the server: ".$command, "\n";

    ## Report the result
    my $result = $results{'client'};
    print "Gene(s) info(s): \n".$result;
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

We can now use additional parameters of the \program{gene-info}
program. For example, we could use regular expressions to ask the
server for all the yeast genes whose name starts with 'MET', followed
by one or several numbers.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
... (same as above)

## Gene-info parameters
my $organism = 'Saccharomyces_cerevisiae';  ## Name of the query organism
my @queries = ('MET\d+');  ## This query is a regular expression
my $full = 1;  ## Looking for full match, not substring match.

my %args = ('organism' => $organism,
	    'query' => \@queries,
	    'full' => $full);

... (same as above)

\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

We can also extend the search to match the query strings against gene
descriptions (by default, they are only matched against gene names).


\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
... (same as above)

## Gene-info parameters
my $organism = 'Escherichia_coli_K12';  ## Name of the query organism
my @queries = ("methionine", "purine");  ## List of queries
my $full = 0;
my $descr = 1;  ## Search also in description field of genes

my %args = ('organism' => $organism,
	    'query' => \@queries,
	    'full' => $full,
	    'descr' => $descr);

... (same as above)
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}


\subsection{Documentation}

We saw above that the command \command{gene-info} can be called with
various options. The description of the available options can be found
in the documentation of the RSATWS web services at the following URL.

\subsection{Work flow using RSATWS}

The following example is the script of a typical workflow of RSA Tools
programs. First, the upstream sequences of five Saccharomyces
cerevisiae genes are retrieved with \program{retrieve-seq}. Then,
\program{purge-sequence} is applyed to remove any redundancy in the
set of sequences. Finally, \program{oligo-analysis} is applied to
discover over-represented six letters words. The result of step 1 and
2 are stored on the server, so that the file name can be sent to the
following step as input and only the final result needs to be
transported from the server to the client.

\subsection{Example of clients using property files}
We have also made clients using an alternative approach. Instead of writing
the parameters values in the client code itself, these are read from a
property file. Here is the client for retrieve-seq:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
# retrieve-seq_client.pl - Client retrieve-seq using the SOAP::WSDL module
# and a property file

################################################################
##
## This script runs a simple demo of the web service inerface to the
## RSAT tool retrieve-seq. It sends a request to the server for
## obtaining the start codons of 3 E.coli genes.
##
################################################################

use strict;
use SOAP::WSDL;
use Util::Properties;

## WSDL location
my $server = 'http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/web_services';
my $WSDL = $server.'/RSATWS.wsdl';
my $proxy = $server.'/RSATWS.cgi';
my $property_file = shift @ARGV;
die "\tYou must specify the property file as first argument\n"
  unless $property_file;

## Service call
my $soap=SOAP::WSDL->new(wsdl => $WSDL)->proxy($proxy);
$soap->wsdlinit;

my $prop =  Util::Properties->new();
$prop->file_name($property_file);
$prop->load();
my %args = $prop->prop_list();

## Convert the query string into a list
my @queries = split(",", $args{query});
$args{query} = \@queries;

my $output_choice = $args{output_choice} || 'both';

warn "\nThis demo script retrieves upstream sequences for a set of query genes\n\n";

## Send the request to the server
print "Sending request to the server $server\n";
my $som = $soap->call('retrieve_seq' => 'request' => \%args);

## Get the result
if ($som->fault){ ## Report error if any
    printf "A fault (%s) occured: %s\n", $som->faultcode, $som->faultstring;
} else {
    my $results_ref = $som->result;  ## A reference to the result hash table
    my %results = %$results_ref;  ## Dereference the result hash table

    ## Report the remote command
    my $command = $results{'command'};
    print "Command used on the server: ".$command, "\n";

    ## Report the result
    if ($output_choice eq 'server') {
	my $server_file = $results{'server'};
	print "Result file on the server: ".$server_file;
    } elsif ($output_choice eq 'client') {
	my $result = $results{'client'};
	print "Retrieved sequence(s): \n".$result;
    } elsif ($output_choice eq 'both') {
	my $server_file = $results{'server'};
	my $result = $results{'client'};
	print "Result file on the server: ".$server_file;
	print "Retrieved sequence(s): \n".$result;
    }
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

The property file looks like this:
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
output=both
organism=Escherichia_coli_K12
query=metA,metB
all=0
noorf=1
from=0
to=2
feattype=CDS
type=upstream
format=fasta
lw=0
label=id,name
label_sep=
nocom=0
repeat= 0
imp_pos=0
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

To run the client, give the path of the property file as argument.

In the downloadable clients, the ones with a name like *\_client.pl use a
property file. Examples of property files are in the sub-directory
'property\_files'. When the property file contains the path to a file, make
sure you edit it according to your system.

\subsection{Other tools in RSATWS}

Following the examples above or using the code that is available for
download\urlref{http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/web\_services.html}, you
can easily access the other RSA Tools for which Web Services have been
implemented. You will find all you need to know about the tools
(parameters, etc.) in the
documentation\urlref{http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/web\_services/RSATWS\_documentation.xml}.

\section{Examples of WS client in java}

First, you need to generate the libraries. There are tools, like Axis,
which do it from the WSDL document. These usually take the URL of that
document as one of their parameters. In our case, it is there:

\small{\url{http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/web\_services/RSATWS.wsdl}}

Then you write a simple client like the one in the following example.

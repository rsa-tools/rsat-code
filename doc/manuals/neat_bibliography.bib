  title = {Evaluation of clustering algorithms for protein-protein interaction
	networks.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {488},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein interactions are crucial components of all cellular
	processes. Recently, high-throughput methods have been developed
	to obtain a global description of the interactome (the whole network
	of protein interactions for a given organism). In 2002, the yeast
	interactome was estimated to contain up to 80,000 potential interactions.
	This estimate is based on the integration of data sets obtained by
	various methods (mass spectrometry, two-hybrid methods, genetic studies).
	High-throughput methods are known, however, to yield a non-negligible
	rate of false positives, and to miss a fraction of existing interactions.
	The interactome can be represented as a graph where nodes correspond
	with proteins and edges with pairwise interactions. In recent years
	clustering methods have been developed and applied in order to extract
	relevant modules from such graphs. These algorithms require the specification
	of parameters that may drastically affect the results. In this paper
	we present a comparative assessment of four algorithms: Markov Clustering
	(MCL), Restricted Neighborhood Search Clustering (RNSC), Super Paramagnetic
	Clustering (SPC), and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE). RESULTS:
	A test graph was built on the basis of 220 complexes annotated in
	the MIPS database. To evaluate the robustness to false positives
	and false negatives, we derived 41 altered graphs by randomly removing
	edges from or adding edges to the test graph in various proportions.
	Each clustering algorithm was applied to these graphs with various
	parameter settings, and the clusters were compared with the annotated
	complexes. We analyzed the sensitivity of the algorithms to the parameters
	and determined their optimal parameter values. We also evaluated
	their robustness to alterations of the test graph. We then applied
	the four algorithms to six graphs obtained from high-throughput experiments
	and compared the resulting clusters with the annotated complexes.
	CONCLUSION: This analysis shows that MCL is remarkably robust to
	graph alterations. In the tests of robustness, RNSC is more sensitive
	to edge deletion but less sensitive to the use of suboptimal parameter
	values. The other two algorithms are clearly weaker under most conditions.
	The analysis of high-throughput data supports the superiority of
	MCL for the extraction of complexes from interaction networks.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Elucidation of metabolic networks for an increasing number
	of organisms reveals that even small networks can contain thousands
	of reactions and chemical species. The intimate connectivity between
	components complicates their decomposition into biologically meaningful
	sub-networks. Moreover, traditional higher-order representations
	of metabolic networks as metabolic pathways, suffers from the lack
	of rigorous definition, yielding pathways of disparate content and
	size. RESULTS: We introduce a hierarchical representation that emphasizes
	the gross organization of metabolic networks in largely independent
	pathways and sub-systems at several levels of independence. The approach
	highlights the coupling of different pathways and the shared compounds
	responsible for those couplings. By assessing our results on Escherichia
	coli (E.coli metabolic reactions, Genetic Circuits Research Group,
	University of California, San Diego, http://gcrg.ucsd.edu/organisms/ecoli.html,
	'model v 1.01. reactions') against accepted biochemical annotations,
	we provide the first systematic synopsis of an organism's metabolism.
	Comparison with operons of E.coli shows that low-level clusters are

  abstract = {Complex cellular processes are modular and are accomplished by the
	concerted action of functional modules (Ravasz et al., Science 2002;297:1551-1555;
	Hartwell et al., Nature 1999;402:C47-52). These modules encompass
	groups of genes or proteins involved in common elementary biological
	functions. One important and largely unsolved goal of functional
	genomics is the identification of functional modules from genomewide
	information, such as transcription profiles or protein interactions.
	To cope with the ever-increasing volume and complexity of protein
	interaction data (Bader et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2001;29:242-245;
	Xenarios et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2002;30:303-305), new automated
	approaches for pattern discovery in these densely connected interaction
	networks are required (Ravasz et al., Science 2002;297:1551-1555;
	Bader and Hogue, Nat Biotechnol 2002;20:991-997; Snel et al., Proc
	Natl Acad Sci USA 2002;99:5890-5895). In this study, we successfully
	isolate 1046 functional modules from the known protein interaction
	network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae involving 8046 individual pair-wise
	interactions by using an entirely automated and unsupervised graph
	clustering algorithm. This systems biology approach is able to detect
	many well-known protein complexes or biological processes, without
	reference to any additional information. We use an extensive statistical
	validation procedure to establish the biological significance of
	the detected modules and explore this complex, hierarchical network
	of modular interactions from which pathways can be inferred.},

  abstract = {Proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules form a dense network
	of molecular interactions in a cell. Molecules are nodes of this
	network, and the interactions between them are edges. The architecture
	of molecular networks can reveal important principles of cellular
	organization and function, similarly to the way that protein structure
	tells us about the function and organization of a protein. Computational
	analysis of molecular networks has been primarily concerned with
	node degree [Wagner, A. & Fell, D. A. (2001) Proc. R. Soc. London
	Ser. B 268, 1803-1810; Jeong, H., Tombor, B., Albert, R., Oltvai,
	Z. N. & Barabasi, A. L. (2000) Nature 407, 651-654] or degree correlation
	[Maslov, S. & Sneppen, K. (2002) Science 296, 910-913], and hence
	focused on single/two-body properties of these networks. Here, by
	analyzing the multibody structure of the network of protein-protein
	interactions, we discovered molecular modules that are densely connected
	within themselves but sparsely connected with the rest of the network.
	Comparison with experimental data and functional annotation of genes
	showed two types of modules: (i) protein complexes (splicing machinery,
	transcription factors, etc.) and (ii) dynamic functional units (signaling
	cascades, cell-cycle regulation, etc.). Discovered modules are highly
	statistically significant, as is evident from comparison with random
	graphs, and are robust to noise in the data. Our results provide
	strong support for the network modularity principle introduced by
	Hartwell et al. [Hartwell, L. H., Hopfield, J. J., Leibler, S. &
	Murray, A. W. (1999) Nature 402, C47-C52], suggesting that found
	modules constitute the "building blocks" of molecular networks.},
